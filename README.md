# Instructions

1. create a file `.env` with the following variables. Change them to values appropriate for your set up.
`
PORT=8080
BING_KEY=yourkeyhere00000
SERVICE_URL=localhost:8080
`
2. run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. install heroku cli if you don't already have it.
4. start with `heroku local`


It can be run with `npm start`, but the values required in .env would have to be specified as environment variables. Only BING_KEY is actually required.
